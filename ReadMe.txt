Beside the unit test several demonstrations are showing
the usage of the tokenizer and the parser.

BasicDemo
---------
Demonstrates a steam machine of a basic interpreter.
The demo basic program calculates an appleman graphices
with the incredible amoun t of 33.000.000 instances of
basic types in a long time of a several minutes.
But it shows how to define a basic grammar, how
to create a syntax tree and how to convert it to
basic token commands.

Tokenizer Demo
--------------
Demonstrates use of a tokenizer.
Analyzes the tokens of a mathematical expression.
The result is represented in a list of tokens.

Parser Demo
-----------
Demonstrates use of yalloc parser by defining
a grammar for a mathematical expression.
The demonstration analyses the input and
marks errors if existing.

RawParser Demo
--------------
Demonstrates use of the raw parser without
integrated tokenizer by defining
a grammar for a mathematical expression.
The demonstration analyses the input and
marks errors if existing.

SyntaxTreeDemo
--------------
Demonstrates creating a syntax tree throughout
a grammar.
A mathematical expressein is parsed, converted
to a syntax tree then transformed to a
dot.net expression tree.
The result of the calculation is printed out.
